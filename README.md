## Facial Recognition Application 

Developed a real-time facial recognition application using OpenCV joined with Flask, capable of recognizing and differentiating up to two simultaneous users with a ~95% accuracy rate.

This project is the development of a web application that integrates real-time facial recognition capabilities using Flask, a micro web framework in Python, for handling user interactions and OpenCV for computer vision tasks. The application allows users to create training datasets by capturing face images, trains a face recognition model using LBPH, and recognizes and differentiates individuals in real-time by streaming video frames to the client from a webcame connected to your computer.
